# Funko-Pop-Client

A Client-side React application to interact with Funko Pop Server.
Server houses a database of more than 10,000 items to use to create collections and wishlists.

Users can create accounts and when logged in; can create collections or wishlists.
Users are validated, and admin users have access to priviledged functions.

Some functionality will be added later; such as ability to send items from wishlist to colleciton.

The original database was constructed in Jan. 2021 by Kenny Chan (https://github.com/kennymkchan),
and can be found here: https://github.com/kennymkchan/funko-pop-data.git.  Since that time(Oct 2021), 
the website providing the images for the original product has destroyed the database and constructed
a new one.  The admin @ HobbyDB.com are not currently able to assist with student projects at this time.
(They do allow use of their database to other sites; but after contacting them for permission, they 
replied with a polite decline and updated their page to avoid future requests)

Design was kept minimal to accomodate mobile viewpoints without extra formatting. Also I am
learning to practice "Less is More" when it comes to design(but I couldn't escape my tendancy
toward bright colors). Not loving the Nav just yet, probably will change that component
in the future. Also would benefit from pagination that I did not add yet.
